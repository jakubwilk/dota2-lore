# Dota2 Lore

Not everyone but small group of people, who plays in Dota2 and really likes the story part of each hero, they know that Dota2 has... really messed lore. This project is a complex website which is filled a custom Dota2 lore with custom heroes stories, regions descriptions and additional stuffs added by me, for fun.

## About

This project is using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a tool to create React application. Supported by TypeScript template, SCSS modules and [Ant Design](https://ant.design) for some controls and layout. Inspiration to create it was a League of Legends lore website which I really like, the website, not game. The main goal is to create a complex website where each hero and region has his own description and related stories, everything customized by me and maybe future editors. The source of content is [Strapi](https://strapi.io) hosted locally for now, but in future it will be moved to dedicated hosting for better accessibility for editors and me of course. I am treating this project as my personal toy, it's nothing serious and everything is for fun, for people who have too much imagination.

## Tools

1. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
2. TypeScript... well I think it's obvious, right?
3. SCSS Modules for better styling
4. [Ant Design](https://ant.design) with Less transpiler
5. [Craco](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco) to customize built-in webpack config
6. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), I don't feel like I need to use React-Query. I want it, but I think this is not a project, where RQ would be good, or I would be able to use 100% of RQ.
7. Google Fonts, because defaults are ugly as &#$%
8. [Strapi](https://strapi.io) for content management, and it's first time when I am using it
